Since I am not completely sure which topic I am wanting to write my white paper on, I went ahead and thought I would look up sources for plant based diets. All of these articles that I found really sparked some ideas. It seems as though there are a lot of people who are unaware of the benefits that come with a plant based diet. By writing this white paper, I can take a very beneficial topic that has research behind it and simplify if for others to read. I guess in a way it could be seen as a persuasive message, however, I really would like to go more towards the informative angle. These articles have a lot of information on the benefits of a plant based diet as well as some of the controversial ideas. They also provide information on different ways of looking at plant based diets.
